============================

The official Scala Days App for Android handcrafted by [47 Degrees](http://www.47deg.com). You can download Scala Days from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fortysevendeg.android.scaladays)

Scala on Android
==============

This application is written entirely in Scala on Android. We are excited to make the application open source and share the code with you. We have used the [macroid](http://macroid.github.io/) library extensively in this project. In addition we have contributed our own Macroid extensions to this application, that can be found here: [macroid-extras](https://github.com/47deg/macroid-extras).

Compile
======

You can compile this project and contribute improvements. To compile the project:

* Download [Activator](https://typesafe.com/community/core-tools/activator-and-sbt) and install it
* Configure the Android SDK on your computer
* Clone this GitHub project to your computer
* From project root directory run:

```
$ ./activator
```

* Connect your phone and execute:

```
> run
```

You can use your favorite IDE. At 47 Degrees we use IntelliJ with the Scala plugin. If you want to run this project from IntelliJ you only need to import the project.

Add Debug Keys
========

You need to add a `debug.properties` file to the root project with the necessary keys to compile. The content should be:

```
google.map.key=***
localytics.key=***
google.project.number=***
google.analytics.key=***
twitter.app.key=***
twitter.app.secret=***
twitter.app.callback.host=***
crashlytics.apikey=***
crashlytics.apisecret=***
```

If you do not want to utilize the `Crashlytics` service, you should create an environment variable `CRASHLYTICS_ENABLED=false`


Contribute
========

You can contribute to this application and we will do our best to upload your changes to Google Play
